------

## Purpose Here

**This is simply my way of learning.** 

The purpose of these presentations are to help me apply these concepts and practices, and help teach/coach others. 

---

<!-- .slide: id="portfolio" -->

## SAFe Portfolio

* Is a collection of **Development Value Streams**
* Each DVS builds, supports and maintains Solutions
* Solutions are delivered to Customers
* (whether internal or external to enterprise)

---

## Traditional Approach

------

People organized in functional silos and temporary project teams.

------

Fund projects and project-cost accounting. Slow, blame game, resource scramble, etc.

------

Big up-front, top-down, annual planning and budgeting.

------

Centralized, unlimited work intake. Project overload.

------

Overly detailed business cases based on speculative ROI.

------

Projects governed by phase gates. Waterfall milestones. Progress mesured by task completition.

------

Value delivery in silos is inhibited by hand-offs and delays. Political boundares can prevent cooperation across silos. Communication across silos is difficult.

------

## Project Cost Accounting

**Disadvantages**

* Utilization-based planning
* Complex budgeting process
* Cuts acrss multiple cost-centers

---

## Lean-Agile Approach

------

People organized in value streams / ART's for continuous value flow.

------

Fund value streams, Lean budgets, and guardrails. Not affected by feature overruns or changing priorities.

------

Value stream budgets adjusted dynamically through paricipatory budgeting.

------

Strategic demand managed by Portfolio Kanban. Decentralized intake by value streams and ARTs.

------

Lean business cases with MVP, business outcome hypothesis, Agile forecasting and estimating.

------

Products and services governed by self-managing ARTs. Objective measures and milestones based on working solutions. 

------

Customers do not buy Features or Capabilities. Rather, they buy whole product Solutions that deliver desired outcomes, which make Solutions one 
of the central concepts in SAFe

------

## Lean-Agile Budgeting

**Advantages**

* Effective financial controls with less overhead
* Adjusted over time to take advantage of opportunities

---

<!-- .slide: id="strategy-investment" -->

# 1

## Strategy & Investment Funding

Ensures the entire portfolio is aligned and funded to create and maintain the solutions needed to meet business targets. 

------

## Roles 

* Enterprise Executives
* Business Owners
* Enterprise Architects

------

## Responsibilities

* Connect the portfolio to enterprise strategy
* Maintain the portfolio vision and roadmap
* Establish Lean budgets and guardrails
* Establish portfolio flow with the portfolio Kanban

------

## Strategic Themes

Small set of business objectives that connect a portfolio to the enterprise strategy and guide the portfolio to the desired future state. 

------

## Strategic Themes shape...

* Portfolio Vision
* Portfolio Kanban and Portfolio Backlog
* Vision for Solution, ART, and Team Backlogs
* Value Stream Budgets
* Lean Budget Guardrails

------

## Method: OKRs

Measure **portfolio performance** relative to **strategic themes**.

* Objectives are inspirational
* Objectives are clear and measurable
* Objectives have two to five key results

------

## Portfolio KPIs

Portfolio KPIs measure how a **value stream** performs against its forecasted **business outcomes**. 

[See More Here](#/performance)

------

Strategic themes and Lean budgets are ***outputs*** of enterprise strategy formulation.

The **portfolio context** is an ***input*** to the evolving enterprise strategy.

------

## Enterprise Strategy Formulation

* Enterprise vision, mission, and core values
* Enterprise business drivers
* Distintive (core) competence
* Financial goals
* Competitive environment
* **Portfolio context**

------

## Enterprise Strategy Outputs

* Portfolio budgets
* Strategic themes

------

## Portfolio Context

* Portfolio Vision
* Lean budget guardrails
* Outcomes, flow, competency
* Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* Qualitiative Data

------

## Portfolio Vision

Long-term view for decision making

------

## Destination Postcard

Book: Switch (link)

Aspirational, yet realistic and achievable. Motivational enough to engage others on the journey. Result: Everyone starts thinking about how to apply their strengths in order to get there. 

------

## Portfolio Canvas

**Business Model Canvas (BMC)** with additions of:

* Value Stream
* Solutions
* Lean Budget
* KPIs / OKRs

Plus BMC parts: customer segment, channels, customer relationships, key partners, key activities, key resources, cost structure and revenue streams.

------

## Evaluate Alternatives

1. Current State Portfolio Canvas (PC)
1. SWOT and TOWS analysis
1. Divergent thinking ➡️ Multiple potential PCs
1. Convergent thinking ➡️ Future State PC
1. Identify Epics

------

## SWOT & TOWS

* **Strengths** (Internal Origin)
* **Weakness** (Internal Origin)
* **Opportunities** (External Origin)
* **Threats** (External Origin)

Opportunities identify strategic options to create a better future state.

------

* SO = How can your **S** be used to exploit **O**?
* ST = How can you apply your **S** to overcome **T**?
* WO = How can your **O** be used to overcome **W**?
* WT = How can you minimize **W** as to avoid **T**?

------

## Lean Budgets

The Enterprise establishes the total portfolio budget, which is allocated to Development Value Streams to develop Solutions.

Funding value streams instead of projects allows the portfolio to plan, invest, and manage capacity based via a **product delivery approach**. 

------

## Advantage of Funding by VS

It is easier to forecast expenses for a Program Increment (PI).

------

## Lean Budget Guardrails

Purpose is to describe budgetary, governance, and spending practices of the portfolio.

* Guide investments by horizons
* Apply capacity allocation 
* Approve significant initiatives
* Continuous business owner engagement

------

## Capacity Allocation

In Jira equates to **Initiatives** (top-level)

------

## Epic Types

**Business Epics** 

Directly deliver business value

**Enabler Epics** 

Support the Architectural Runway and future business functionality.

Consider potential of increating risk by sequencing Epics incorrectly.

------

## Epic Elevator Pitch

* **For** (customers)
* **Who** (Do something)
* **The** (solution)
* **Is a** (the "how")
* **That** (provides value)
* **Unlike** (competitor / current solution / gap)
* **Our solution** (the "why")

------

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

As opposed to story boards, prototypes, mockups, and other exploratory techniques, the MVP is an actual product that can be used by real Customers to generate validated learning

**MVPs enable faster learning, less risk, better decisions, and improved time-to-market.**


------

## Lean Startup Cycle

1. **Hypothesize** - Lean business case
2. **Build an MVP** - To test the hypothesis
3. **Evaluate MVP** - Against the hypothesis

------

## Then...

* **Pivot** - New epic, new hypothesis in backlog
* **Persevere** - Continue, provided is WSFJ
* **Stop** - Discontinue any further work on epic

------

## Types of Pivots

* **Customer segment** pivot
* **Customer need** pivot
* **Value capture** pivot
* **Zoom-in** (Feature) pivot

---

## Sequencing Epics

**For optimal economics**

Epics that can deliver the most value and are of the shortest duration are selected first for implementation.

------

## WSFJ

**Weighted Shortest Job First**

Cost of Delay (Value)

*divide by*

Duration (Cost)

------

## Cost of Delay

* User Business Value
* Time Criticality
* Risk Reduction / Opportunity Enablement

------

## Relative Rating

On a scale of 1-to-10 rate each Epic. Go column by column.

Identify lowest Epic and rate against other Epics being prioritised. 

Tally the CoD for each Epic

------

## Normalise Costs

Give the lowest cost Epic a 1.0 then divide the **$** cost of the other Epics by the **$** cost of the this Epic

------

## WSFJ Priority Order

Implement the Epic with the **highest WSFJ first**.

------

Progress is measured as outcomes against the benefit hypothesis.

------

Lean business case, based on benefit hypothesis and definition of MVP.

------

Implementation follows the build-measure-learn SAFe Lean Startup Cycle.

------

After the Lean business case is approved, commitment is to the evaluation of the MVP.

---

## Projects

**Epics are not Projects**

------

Implemented by temporary teams, which disband after work is completed. 

------

Definitive start and end dates. Scope is fixed. All scope must be implemented.

------

Progress is measured on task completion.

------

Overly detailed business case, based on speculative ROI.

------

Implementation typically follows phase-gated, sequential (waterfall) process.

------

After business case is approved, up-front commitment is made to the entire project scope.

* Flow Time
* Flow Load
* Flow Efficiency
* Flow Predictability

------

## Flow Distribution

Proportion of work items by type in a system

Example: Business vs Enabler epics

------

## Flow Velocity

Number of items completed in a given timeframe

Also known as the system's throughput

------

## Flow Time

Total time elapsed for all steps in a workflow

Measure fo efficiency of the entire system

Example: Code commit to deployment

------

## Flow Load

How many items are currently in the system

Often a leading indicator of excess work-in-progress

Measuring and reducing flow load is of critical importance

------

## Cumulative Flow Diagram 

Is common tool to visualize **flow load** over time. Shows rate at which items are accepted into the work queue (arrival curve) and the rate at which they are completed (departure curve). At a point in time, flow load is the vertical distance between curves.

------

## Flow Efficiency

How much of the overall flow time is value-added work vs waiting between steps

Equals: **Total Active Time / Flow Time** (Active + Wait Time)

------

## Flow Predictability

How well teams, ARTs, and Solution Trains can plan and meet their PI objectives.

**Planned value achieved / Actual value achieved**

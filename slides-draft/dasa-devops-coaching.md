------

### Individual vs Organization

> The Change journeys undertaken at an individual level or at an organization level are distinct. 
> A team, as a group of individuals, can potentially go through the change journey of an individual. 
> Alternatively, the team as a microcosm of an organization can also go through the change journey to be described for an organization.

------

### Individual Journey of Change

Elisabeth Kubler-Ross Model or **Grief Cycle**

1. Denial (Info + Comms)
2. Resistance (Info + Comms)

5. Commitment (Guide + Direct)

* Can we get additional resources?

------

### Experimentation

* Can we try some alternate options?
* How about if we invest in tools / training?

------

### Commitment

* Happy that we got through this
* Happy to contribute to this

------

## Five Dysfunctions of Team

#### By Patrick Lencioni

------

### Lack of Trust

> DevOps is about culture and collaboration, and the most important cultural and collaboration ingredient a team must establish and cultivate is trust.

------

### Fear of Conflict

> Roger Martin in his book **The Opposable Mind**, argues that “the ability to face constructively the 
tension of opposing ideas and, instead of choosing one at the expense of the other, generate a 
creative resolution of the tension in the form of a new idea that contains elements of the opposing 
ideas but is superior to each.

------

### Lack of Commitment

> Like any other people, team members will buy into something when their opinions are included in the 
decision-making process. Productive teams co-create transparent decisions and are confident that 
they have the support of each team member. The co-creation is not about seeking consensus but 
making sure everyone is heard

------

### Avoidance of Accountability

> A DevOps Coach can also support the team members to develop their confidence to hold one another 
accountable and clarify exactly what the team needs to achieve, who is responsible to deliver what 
and how others must behave in order to make it successful.

------

### Inattention to Results

> Inattention to result is the ultimate dysfunction of a team. It exists when individualism takes the 
precedence over collectivism. Group members seek out individual recognition and credibility at the 
cost of the collective results of the team and what the team should achieve.

---

## Building Trust

#### ( C + R + I )/ S

------

### Credibility

* Logical, clear communicator
* Honest and open
* Demonstrates expertise
* Strong credentials

------

### Reliability

* Consistent
* Sees word as bond
* No surprises

------

### Intimacy

* Others confide in
* Empathetic
* Discreet

------

### Self-Orientated

* Moves on easily from disappointment
* Leads with curiosity, other-focus
* Comfortable changing agendas / objectives
* Focus on long-term relationships
* Achieve goals through other's achievements

------

### Collaborating

**High Cooperation, High Assertiveness**

> The ideal strategy is win-win, which corresponds to both individuals staying firm about
protecting their interests while being sensitive about the other’s interests. In reality, the 
percentage of conflicts being resolved in this manner would be small. They tend to get
resolved through other strategies

------

### Avoiding

**Low Cooperation, Low Assertiveness**
> It is the stage where there no effort is taken to further one’s interests or yield to the other’s
interests. It is a no-action passive state. Most of the time, this tends to be a sub-optimal 
approach to conflict resolution. It demonstrates a lack of responsiveness and ownership for
the issue at hand. It could also keep the conflict lingering for a long time.

------

### Competing

**Low Cooperation, High Assertiveness**

> This is the stage where you may feel that your interests are of paramount importance and 
imperative to safeguard these. Typically, these can come out of contractual culpability 
conflicts. It may seem that you are not interested in resolving the conflict. This position does
not mean that there is no dialogue, but that there is a huge responsibility to provide as much 
data and facts as required to persuade the other party to your point of view

------

### Accommodating

**High Cooperation, Low Assertiveness**

> This is the stage where you feel it is fine to yield to the other party based on your assessment
of the risks to your interests (being sufficiently low) and the need to nurture the relationship
from a long-term perspective.

### CEO Support

I read a Lean book and in the first paragraph the author said: "If your CEO doesn't support Lean, then don't bother trying"

### Embrace

Focus on building shared understanding of the "why". Buying into why we are doing it is key.

------

### Values & Principles

Again... build a shared understanding of SAFe Princples (lunk) and the Agile Manifesto (link).

Note: "We are uncovering better ways" = Continous improvement. "Where we find value" = Goal.

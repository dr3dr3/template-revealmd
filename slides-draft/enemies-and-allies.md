### Frequent Small Changes

"Maxine loves it when everyone merges their changes frequently to the 'master branch' such as once per day. That way, the size of the changes being merged are never allowed to get too large. Small batch sizes, like in manufacturing, create a smooth flow, with no jarring disruptions or catastrophes."

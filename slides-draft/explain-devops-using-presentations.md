title: Demonstrating DevOps using Reveal.JS Presentations
---

### This is a presentation

Duh üòè

---

# To Explain DevOps

By using a presentation ü§®

---

This presentation was built

and deployed using DevOps

ü§´

---

### This slide deck...

- Explains DevOps in a simple way
- Using presentations as an analogy
- To show why DevOps is valuable
- So everyone can understand

---

And you could use presentations like these

Credit to Hakim and X We are using Reveal.JS (link) and Reveal-MD A simple open source project for creating awesome
online presentations... an alternative to PowerPoint (bored emoji)

Go left for the first key DevOps concept

---

# Version Control

----

(definition)

----

Think of versioning a PowerPoint slide deck...

- You have to add version to the filename
- Share it in a central location
- Or send files between between people
- Make sure final version is locked down
- And juggle updates and what version ppl have

(Link to PowerPoint pain)

## Git for Version Control

Git is a powerful VC system used for X% of the software today. Companies like Microsoft, Atlassian, AWS provide Git as a
service and with GitHub hugely popular

----

The content for this slide is in a Git code repository hosted by GitHub.

(Link to repo)

----

### By doing this we can...

- See a complete history of all changes made
- In a single place that all contributers use
- With flexible control over those changes
- Able to have multiple draft versions in flight
- Can be fast and easy to manage

----

(Quote and link to article on using git for content version Control)

----

Reveal.JS and the software tools used to create this slide deck are in Git repos, many on GitHub.com

----

You could "clone" the repo we use to create this deck to create your own. Everything is covered here for you to create
(with version Control) your own presentations (DevOps style)

Version Control is fundamental for DevOps

# ‚û°Ô∏è

More information:

- How we use Semantic Versioning

## Version Control + DevOps

---

Version Control is fundamental for software development.

It's not a DevOps thing

But how it is used it is

ü•∑üèª

Enter the battle...

## Gitflow vs TBD

## üò´

## Next ‚û°Ô∏è

Introducing key DevOps concepts:

- Small batches
- Trunk based development
- Agile workflows

---

# Small batches

----

(Lean concept)

----

# Trunk based development

----

(Is how we do small batches effectively, using version control)

---

# Agile workflows

----

(Many teams using Agile practices now... Like Kanban boards, Scrum, SAFe... And tools like Trello, JIRA, Asana, etc)

----

Important to understand that Agile is a broad term...

What is most valuable is understanding the lessons learnt that led to the core principle in Agile

# ü§ü

----

Agile is a way of working

(Link to manifesto)

----

# Here

We use GitHub Projects to manage our Agile workflow using a simple Kanban board

(Link)

----

Our Agile workflow encompasses how we make content and code changes in our version control Git repository

----

The workflow follows the DevOps practices of small batches and TBD

----

Value we get from these DevOs practices

- Many small updates to our slide deck
- Done via a clear and Agile process
- Fully tracked and visible to all involved
- Ready for CI/CD (next topic)

----

More information:

- We deploy X times per day (Dora metrics slide)
